# Audio Feature Extraction Guidance

This repository contains three Jupyter Notebooks that demonstrate various methods for extracting and analyzing audio features from audio signals. Each notebook focuses on a different technique and provides step-by-step guidance along with visualizations to help you understand the feature extraction process.

## File Functionality Overview

- **pd_feature.ipynb:**  
  - Demonstrates the extraction and analysis of PD features from audio signals.
  - Includes steps for loading audio data, processing the signal, and visualizing the extracted PD features.
  - Useful for understanding how power or other domain-specific metrics can be derived from audio.

- **stft_feature2.ipynb:**  
  - Focuses on extracting features using the Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT).
  - Converts time-domain audio signals into a time-frequency representation.
  - Provides visualizations to analyze how the frequency content of the audio evolves over time.

- **mfcc_feature2.ipynb:**  
  - Shows how to compute Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs), a key feature in speech and audio processing.
  - Walks through preprocessing the audio, extracting MFCCs, and visualizing the results.
  - Ideal for projects related to speech recognition and audio classification.

## Features

- **Audio Preprocessing:** Load and preprocess audio data for feature extraction.
- **Diverse Feature Extraction Methods:** 
  - PD features for specific audio analysis tasks.
  - STFT for time-frequency representation.
  - MFCC for capturing the spectral properties of audio.
- **Visualization:** Each notebook includes plots and charts to help interpret the extracted features.
