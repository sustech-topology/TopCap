# Topology-enhanced Machine Learning for Consonant Recognition
Code material for Topological Data Analysis in Consonant Recognition. The data that support the findings of this study are openly available in SpeechBox, ALLSSTAR Corpus, L1-ENG division at [Home Page of SpeechBox](https://speechbox.linguistics.northwestern.edu/#!/home)

## Data Preprocessing
Using [Montreal Forced Aligner (MFA)](https://montreal-forced-aligner.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) to align each speech into phonetic segments. The detailed guidance of MFA can be found on the [Installation Page](https://montreal-forced-aligner.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html). The following steps help align each speech into phonetic segments. See [Montreal Forced Aligner Tutorial](https://eleanorchodroff.com/tutorial/montreal-forced-aligner.html) for more explanations.

- Download the acoustic model and dictionary.
  ```
  mfa model download acoustic english_us_arpa
  mfa model download dictionary english_us_arpa
  ```
- Convert sampling rate into 16kHz by [wav_modification](https://github.com/AnnFeng233/TDA_Consonant_Recognition/blob/main/wav_modification.ipynb).  
- Align speeches, the output files are in `.TextGrid` format.
  ```
  mfa align ~/mfa_data/my_corpus english_us_arpa english_us_arpa ~/mfa_data/my_corpus_aligned
  ```

## TopCap Construction
Before constructing TopCap, there is a preliminary experiment that measures the performance of topological methods in time series. [fre_amp_av](https://github.com/AnnFeng233/TDA_Consonant_Recognition/blob/main/fre_amp_av.ipynb) helps understand how topological methods distinguish different vibration patterns in time series. The results are shown in [observation_result_refined](https://github.com/AnnFeng233/TDA_Consonant_Recognition/blob/main/observation_result_refined.ipynb)

TopCap is achieved in [csv_writer_consonant](https://github.com/AnnFeng233/TDA_Consonant_Recognition/blob/main/csv_writer_consonant.ipynb), which captures the most significant topological features within those segmented phonetic time series. The output is a `.csv` file containing the birthtime and lifetime corresponding to the point in the persistent diagram with the longest lifetime.  

Further discussions of TopCap are involved in 
- [observation_dimension](https://github.com/AnnFeng233/TDA_Consonant_Recognition/blob/main/observation_dimension.ipynb) illustrates how dimension influences time delay embedding and persistent diagrams.
- [observation_dimension_plot](https://github.com/AnnFeng233/TDA_Consonant_Recognition/blob/main/observation_dimension_plot.ipynb) includes parameters and graph in the discussion section.
- [observation_skip](https://github.com/AnnFeng233/TDA_Consonant_Recognition/blob/main/observation_skip.ipynb) illustrates how skip influences computation time.

## Machine Learning for Topological Features
Matlab (R2022b) [classification learner application](https://www.mathworks.com/help/stats/classificationlearner-app.html), 5-fold cross-validation, set aside 30\% records as test data. Use the following automatic built-in algorithm: Optimizable Tree, Optimizable Discriminant, Efficient Logistic Regression, Optimizable Naive Bayes, Optimizable SVM, Optimizable KNN, Kernel, Optimizable Ensemble, and Optimizable Neural Network. The CNN model is obtained in [deep_learning](https://github.com/AnnFeng233/TDA_Consonant_Recognition/blob/main/deep_learning.ipynb), where data used in this model come from [stft_plot_maker_refine](https://github.com/AnnFeng233/TDA_Consonant_Recognition/blob/main/stft_plot_maker_refine.ipynb), the some resulting images are contained in [stft_image](https://github.com/AnnFeng233/TDA_Consonant_Recognition/tree/main/supplements/stft_image) in supplementary.

## Supplements
The folder `supplements` includes supplementary files for this project. 

- The `results` folder contains ROC, and AUC for machine learning, as well birthtime, lifetime of consonants.
- The `consonants_waveforms` folder contains waveforms of pulmonic consonants. Audio for these consonants comes from [Wiki-List of consonants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_consonants). This gives consonants concrete shapes for readers.
